Unlike regular scripts, ES6 modules are subject to same-origin policy. 
This means that you cannot import them from the file system or cross-origin without a CORS header (which cannot be set for local files).

Basically you need to run this code from a (local) server or disable same-origin in the browser for testing (do not do this permanently).
